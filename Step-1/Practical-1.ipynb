    "## Intro\n",
    "This exercise is a first step in a series of four. The final objective is to determine the actual evapotranspiration of the Hupsel catchment in the first weeks of May 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we do not have direct observations of the current surface fluxes (either eddy-covariance, lysimeters or through scintillometry) we split the process in two major steps (left and right in the figure below):\n",
    "a. understand how the ET in Hupsel catchment responds to external forcings, based on historical data from Hupsel and elswhere;\n",
    "b. use that process understanding to make the best possible estimate of the ET of the Hupsel catchment in the past weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The current land-use in the Hupsel catchment can be simplified as a mixture of grass and bare soil (the maize is just emerging). Today we focus on understanding the response of grass and bare soil to external forcings (step 1 and 2). In the second practical we will finish step 3 and 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of reference evapotranspiration is dealt with extensively in the [book used for Atmosphere Vegetation Soil Interactions](https://www-cambridge-org.ezproxy.library.wur.nl/core/books/transport-in-the-atmospherevegetationsoil-continuum/5944F8B7ADAC6409AD4575642431B2DC) (chapter 7 and 8). A summary of the [most essential concepts](reference_ET_concept.pdf) is also available.\n",

    "## The method\n",
    "The logic of this practical is that reference ET is supposed to contain all main meteorological drivers of evapotranspiration. By comparing the reference ET with the observed actual ET (based on eddy-covariance measurements) we can find out if there are additional external factors that need to be taken into account. \n",
    "\n",
    "If all relevant information would be contained in reference ET, the crop factor (ET<sub>act</sub> / ET<sub>ref</sub>) would be constant. If it varies in time, that is an indication that additional factors play a role.\n",
