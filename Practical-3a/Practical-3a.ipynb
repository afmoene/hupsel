    "\n",
    "Your conclusion was that for some weather conditions and surface types ET<sub>act</sub> was larger than ET<sub>ref</sub>, for other moments it was lower. So a fixed 'crop factor' for a given surface is not enough to come to a good estimate of ET<sub>act</sub>. But based on the work you did before, you should be able to translate your knowledge about the variation of the crop factor into a new dataset: the data of May 2021.\n",

    "The steps to take are:\n",

    "* Determine the day-to-day values for the catchment-mean ET<sub>act</sub>\n",
