    "## Intro\n",
    "Until now you have solely used the Makkink method to determine the reference evapotranspiration. Although the methods originates in the Netherlands, it is gaining traction in scientific literature in the past 20 years. Methods that are internationally more commonly used are Priestley-Taylor and Penman-Monteith. In particular the latter, as it forms the basis for the standard method of the FAO to determine crop evapotranspiration (FAO: Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN). \n",
    "\n",
    "Some additional information about the various reference ET methods, and in particular the details on how to apply the Penman-Monteith equation in the context of the FAO guidelines, is given in this [overview](reference_ET_concept.pdf). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you will compute the reference ET with three methods (Makkink, Priestley-Taylor and Penman-Monteith), and compare those to the actual evapotranspiration. For this you will use the 2011 Hupsel data (daily means) again. Furthermore, we will have a look at the effect of averaging (for which we will use the 30-minute data from 2011).\n",

    "## The method\n",
    "The main steps of the analysis of this exercise are:\n",
    "1. Compute the reference ET with three methods, based on daily mean data\n",
    "2. Compare the results of those three methods between each other\n",
    "3. Compare the results of the three methods with the actual evapotranspiration\n",
    "In the last two steps you will certainly find differences. Those difference may well be related to the specific weather conditions or surface conditions. Hence, your analysis of the weather conditions during May 2011, which you made in Step-1, will come in handy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the steps you have done in Practical-1 already, namely computing ET<sub>ref</sub> with Makkink and computing ET<sub>act</sub> from the eddycovariance data. There is no need to copy over the results from Step-1 as you will easily reproduce them here. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence the main tasks will be to \n",
    "* implement functions for the Priestley-Taylor and Penman-Monteith method\n",
    "* do the comparison\n",
