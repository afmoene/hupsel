    "## The method\n",

    "\n",
    "Your conclusion was that for some weather conditions and surface types ET<sub>act</sub> was larger than ET<sub>ref</sub>, for other moments it was lower. So a fixed 'crop factor' for a given surface is not enough to come to a good estimate of ET<sub>act</sub>. But based on the work you did before, you should be able to translate your knowledge about the variation of the crop factor into a new dataset: the data of May 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps to take are:\n",
    "* Determine ET<sub>ref</sub> for May 2022\n",
    "* Determine appropriate day-to-day 'crop factors' (based on your insights from step 1 and 2) for\n",
    "  * grass\n",
    "  * bare soil\n",
    "* Apply those crop factors to determine a time series of ET<sub>act</sub> for the dominant land use in the Hupsel catchment for May 2022\n",
    "  * grass\n",
    "  * bare soil\n",
    "* Determine the day-to-day values for the catchment-mean ET<sub>act</sub>\n",
