    "## Context\n",
    "During most of the practical you will work with observations that were gathered over a limited amount of time (a few weeks at most) and only one area (the Hupsel catchment). However, in order to understand how land-atmosphere processes work on larger time scales and other locations we need additional data. Those are available through [FluxNet](https://fluxnet.fluxdata.org/): a collection of flux data from hundreds of sites world-wide. The map below shows the location of sites from which data are available in Fluxnet (including the length of the timeseries).\n",
